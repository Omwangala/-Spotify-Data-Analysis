 # Spotify Data Analysis using PostgreSQL

## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores a **Spotify dataset** using **PostgreSQL** to analyze various aspects of music streaming, including artist popularity, track statistics, and streaming performance across platforms like **YouTube and Spotify**. The analysis helps uncover insights such as the most streamed tracks, longest/shortest songs, and trends in streaming platforms.

## 🔍 Questions Answered
Here are the key questions answered through SQL queries:

### **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- 📊 How many total tracks are in the dataset?
- 🎤 How many unique artists and albums are there?
- 🎶 What are the distinct album types?
- ⏳ What is the longest and shortest track duration?
- 🛠 Are there tracks with zero duration? If so, should they be removed?
- 📺 What are the distinct `channels` and `most_played_on` platforms?

### **Track Performance Analysis**
- 🎵 Which tracks have more than **1 billion streams**?
- 📀 List all albums along with their respective artists.
- 💬 What is the total number of comments for licensed tracks?
- 🎧 What are the total streams on **Spotify vs YouTube**?
- 📌 How many tracks belong to album type **'single'**?
- 🏆 Which track has the highest `liveness` score?
- 🔥 Rank the most popular tracks per artist based on views.
- 🚀 Which tracks have **above-average liveness**?

## 🛠 Technologies Used
